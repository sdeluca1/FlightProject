# FlightProject
The final project for my web development class, to build a system that takes an API from Google and allows users to search for flights, airports, cities, and hotels.
Technologies/languages used: HTML, JavaScript, JSON, JQuery, AJAX
Note: Does not currently function due to being linked directly as a subset to inactive course site.
